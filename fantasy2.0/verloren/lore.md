## Threefold Goddess(Witches)
Witches gather in covens to worship the goddess in her three forms. The maiden is new creation of life, the mother extends and nurtures life, and the crone brings life to its end(preparing it for rebirth).

## Music of the Spheres(Priests)
Each of the 7 planets that crosses the sky embodies some energy that resonates through nature. Mages wield planetary energy, but the temples are where the intelligences are consoluted directly and express their will through priests.

## Nature Spirits(Druids)
The world is animistic and spirits gather and anchor to objects and organisms. The smallest of the spirits are sprites who many embody dewdrops, single blades of grass, stones, or small animals. Guardian spirits watch over larger features such as rivers, meadows, forests, and mountains. A grid of way lines run through the world, connecting the currents of natural energies. Where several lines of this grid meet, the energy abounds so heavily that dragons form. Generally, spiritual energy anchors to an existing form as with the spirits gained at birth, or that accumulate on objects. For guardian spirits and dragons, the spirit forms its own body, lending itself shapeshifting properties.

## Ancestors(Necromancer)
Souls are locked into a wheel of rebirth, slowly evolving until they ascend and a new star is born. The stars linger in the sky until they slowly fade out, perhaps to begin their journey anew. These ancestors are known as the mighty ones, the old ones, and other names. 

Necromancers make themselves sensitive to the ancestors as well as the undead spirits who have yet to reincarnate. People who die with unfinished business often linger for decades, or even centuries trying to resolve their blockage. If fed energy from the living, they can be sustained until they form into demons or devils that embody the wrong that kept them from reincarnating. If their business is instead resolved after death, they are freed to be reincarnated again. Failing either method, spirits may simply fade over time until they are dissolved into the animistic force from which nature spirits are made. It is this essence of undeath, spirit that refuses to reincarnate, that a necromancer calls upon to animate corpses.

When people reincarnate, their souls jump back and forth between humans and beast-folk. It's believed a soul incarnates in a human as a test of its development, and the assessment then leads to a species of beast folk to work through whatever life lesson the last incarnation needs to ascend further. After the life as a beast folk, the soul incarnates as a human, back and forth, with the wheel of reincarnation.

## The Left-handed Path(Warlocks)
Darker energies flow throughout the world. Energies such as fear, wrath, envy, and sorrow are created when a life experiences the corresponding emotion. While the undead are suspended in a limbo, the hell that awaits those who fail to return to the wheel of reincarnation is demonhood. Like nature spirits, demons are primarily spirit. Unlike nature spirits, however, demons must find host bodies to possess, as they lack the natural creative force of life. Just as the planets embody universal energies, so do the devils. The devils, however, are the intelligences embodying particular forms of fear, wrath, envy, and sorrow. Warlocks learn to detect and speak with demons and devils. It is by learning to speak to demons that warlocks learn to safely exorcise demons from their hosts. It is by this same ability that warlocks may make powerful pacts with devils.
